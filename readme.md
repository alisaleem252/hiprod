# [HiProd](http://hiprodbeta)

HiProd allows the management and customer staff of the Health Impressions Department to
better manage product and vendors. In version 1.0 we were not aware that ASI Central
provided an API that we could work with. In this version, 90% of the data shown
is provided by [ASI Central's API](http://developers.asicentral.com/). All cache records of ASI data is updated every 30 days.
